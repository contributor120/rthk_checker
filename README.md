# rthk_checker
Checks the archive status, ultra-simple, quite janky

Simply run main.py, has pandas and numpy as dependencies.
Spits out the output as status.csv. Backup_found column says if an entry was found in either the youtube logs or the google sheets.

Note: This is probably underestimating archive status, between unreported archives, poorly formated entries, entries from non-youtube sources, etc...
